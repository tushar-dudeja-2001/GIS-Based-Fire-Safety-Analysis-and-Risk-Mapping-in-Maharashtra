# GIS-Based-Fire-Safety-Analysis-and-Risk-Mapping-in-Maharashtra
This GIS-driven approach transforms static location data into dynamic, actionable intelligence for planning and policy making. Emergency Response Optimization: The generated maps can be used by disaster management authorities to optimize response routes and reduce critical response times during an incident. Strategic Infrastructure Planning: The analysis helps urban planners and state authorities identify the most suitable locations for establishing new fire stations or water supply points (like hydrants) to close the identified coverage gaps. Risk Mitigation: By clearly visualizing the most vulnerable areas, the project supports targeted fire safety awareness campaigns and the implementation of specific mitigation strategies.
